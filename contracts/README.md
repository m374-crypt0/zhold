> **contracts** is a collection of solidity smart contracts to store
> commitments, revoke them and verify ZKP submitted by a **customer** to ensure
> they are eligible regarding a specific **policy** maintained by an **issuer**

## Responsibilities of contracts

### Commitment store contract

1. Expose functions to commit or revoke commitments
2. Ensure those functions are accessible only by the **issuer**
3. Emit events for each state change

### Compliancy prover

1. Expose a function to prove a caller is eligible regarding a policy without
   disclosure of private data

### Verifier

1. Expose a verification function taking a **ZKP** and a set of public inputs
   returning a boolean regarding the **ZKP** is verified or not.

## Trust boundaries

- A trustful **issuer** specified for the commitment store contract deployment
- The compliancy prover contract should not be upgraded without governance
- The verifier contract is dependant of underlying circuit correctness

## Interactions in the entire *zhold* system

## Final words

The **contracts** set contains both developed contracts (*commitment store*,
*compliancy prover*) and contracts generated by **ZKP** tooling (*Verifier*).

### scaling

If needed, this system could scale by creating a pair of *CompliancyProver* and
*Verifier* for each existing **policy**.
